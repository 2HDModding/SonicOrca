# Tools used

I used dotpeek to export the project and dnSpy to reference the scripts while fixing them, I also used [this](https://github.com/maybekoi/FSNSFix) to turn "namespace SonicOrca;" to "namespace SonicOrca {".

## How to build

Clone the project, open the Visual Studio solution file, and you should be good to go!
